🚀 Just built my own Resume Parser with a GUI using Java!
Super excited to share a personal project I’ve been working on recently. 💻

🔍 This project allows users to: ✅ Upload a PDF resume
✅ Automatically extract details like:

📧 Email

📞 Phone number

🔗 LinkedIn profile

🐙 GitHub profile

🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools Used:

Java (core language)

Swing for the GUI

Apache PDFBox for reading PDF files

Regex for pattern matching and data extraction

IDE: IntelliJ IDEA

📁 Structure:

ResumeParser class for PDF parsing and data extraction

GUI built with Java Swing for user interaction

Clean and modular code using PDDocument & PDFTextStripper from PDFBox

🎯 Goal: Simplify resume data extraction — helpful for recruiters, career platforms, and HR tools.

💡 Here's a peek at the GUI and console output 👇
(📸 Attach your screenshots – one of the GUI and one of the console/output window)

👨‍💻 Future Scope:

Add support for parsing skills, education, and experience

Export extracted data as JSON

Android version coming soon 😉
